Objective:

Your task is to generate Sentence B, given Sentence A. Sentence B must achieve structural antithesis with Sentence A. This means each significant word or phrase in Sentence A should have a correspondingly positioned, direct semantic opposite (antonym or clear conceptual opposite) in Sentence B, while maintaining parallel grammatical structure and a mirrored or contrasting tone.
The ideal generated Sentence B would exhibit perfect structural antithesis: every key component from Sentence A is mirrored by a direct opposite in Sentence B, and the structures are perfectly parallel.
A poorly generated Sentence B would fail to achieve this specific antithetical structure (e.g., it might be identical to Sentence A, completely unrelated in structure and word choice, or only share a vague common topic without any word-for-word opposition).
The generated Sentence B should aim for the highest degree of this ideal.

Guiding Examples:

Sentence A: "Love builds strong bridges."
Sentence B: "Hate destroys weak walls."

Sentence A: "The sun shines brightly."
Sentence B: "The moon glows dimly."

Sentence A: "High mountains are always covered in snow."
Sentence B: "Deep valleys are never exposed to sun."

Instructions:

For the provided Sentence A:
Generate Sentence B that achieves structural antithesis with Sentence A.
Provide a concise Explanation justifying your generated Sentence B. Specifically comment on:
- The parallelism of the grammatical structure between Sentence A and your generated Sentence B.
- How the corresponding words/phrases in your generated Sentence B are direct semantic or clear conceptual opposites to those in Sentence A.
