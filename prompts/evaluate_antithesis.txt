Objective:

Your task is to evaluate two sentences (Sentence A and Sentence B) and assign a score from 0.00 to 1.00. This score quantifies how perfectly they achieve structural antithesis, where each significant word or phrase in Sentence A has a correspondingly positioned, direct semantic opposite (antonym or clear conceptual opposite) in Sentence B, while maintaining parallel grammatical structure and a mirrored or contrasting tone.
A score of 1.00 indicates perfect structural antithesis: every key component is mirrored by a direct opposite, and the structures are perfectly parallel.
A score of 0.00 indicates no attempt at or achievement of this specific antithetical structure (e.g., they are identical, completely unrelated in structure and word choice, or only share a vague common topic without any word-for-word opposition).
Scores in between reflect the degree to which this ideal is met.

Guiding Examples:

Sentence A: "Love builds strong bridges."
Sentence B: "Hate destroys weak walls."
Score: 1.00

Sentence A: "The sun shines brightly."
Sentence B: "The moon glows dimly."
Score: 0.84

Sentence A: "High mountains are always covered in snow."
Sentence B: "Deep valleys are never exposed to sun."
Score: 0.72

Sentence A: "Bright stars illuminate dark space."
Sentence B: "Dim lamps light small fields."
Score: 0.53

Sentence A: "The happy dog runs fast."
Sentence B: "A sad person walks around."
Score: 0.30

Sentence A: "Peace actively nurtures fragile alliances."
Sentence B: "War causes long-lasting suffering."
Score: 0.23

Sentence A: "The planet orbits the sun."
Sentence B: "The moon glows dimly."
Score: 0.12

Sentence A: "The quick brown fox jumps."
Sentence B: "The quick brown fox jumps."
Score: 0.00

Sentence A: "I am eating a hamburger."
Sentence B: "The reports show that it will be raining next week."
Score: 0.00

Instructions:

For the provided Sentence A and Sentence B:
Assign a Score (a decimal value between 0.00 and 1.00 inclusive) based on how well they achieve structural antithesis.
Provide a concise Explanation justifying your score. Specifically comment on:
- The parallelism of the grammatical structure.
- The extent to which corresponding words/phrases are direct semantic or clear conceptual opposites.
